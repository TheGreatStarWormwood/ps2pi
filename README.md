##PS2 Controller Library for the Raspberry Pi
 
 This project is built from bits and pieces I've found on the Internet,
 including, but not limited to 
Bill Porter madsci1016/Arduino-PS2X
c-herring/PiPS2

For some reason, I couldn't get the PiPS2 library to work with my Chinese
knockoff PS2 controller, so I sat down and hacked it beyond recognition.
I've probably thrown a dozen babies out with the bath water, but now

IT WORKS FOR ME

To compile, you need the wiringPi library, and if you want to run the curstst program,
you'll need the curses library.
I've included two shell scripsts for your convenience.
