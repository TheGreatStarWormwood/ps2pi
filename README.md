##PS2 Controller Library for the Raspberry Pi
 
 This project is built from bits and pieces I've found on the Internet,
 including, but not limited to 
Bill Porter madsci1016/Arduino-PS2X
c-herring/PiPS2

For some reason, I couldn't get the PiPS2 library to work with my Chinese
knockoff PS2 controller, so I sat down and hacked it beyond recognition.
I've probably thrown a dozen babies out with the bath water, but now

IT WORKS FOR ME
